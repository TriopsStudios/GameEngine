#Game Engine Project

This is a game engine project that I'm writing using C++ and SDL2.0. Initially, the project started as an idea to learn more about C++ and the SDL library, and it was only going to be a library to simplify the use of SDL functions into more understandable and readable functions for me.

Over time, more ideas began to emerge, and thus, I started creating the level editor, which consists of a main window and a palette window where you can select the sprites to be placed in the main window.

#TODO The current idea is to use the game engine to make a DOOM clone, or at least attempt it, for which I will follow these steps:

    Finish the level editor (make it work well, and create a function to save/load levels)

    Make the level editor customizable for user needs

    Continue with a ray-casting implementation so that the created levels can be viewed in "3D"
